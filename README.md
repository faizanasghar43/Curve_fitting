# Curve_fitting
Curve fitting in numerical methods using Python
1. Use least squares regression (linear curve fitting) to fit a straight line to the following data:  
x = [0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19]
y = [5, 6, 7, 6, 9, 8, 7, 10, 12, 12]

a. Slope
b. Intercept
c. Correlation coefficient
d. Relative Errors of the estimate.
e. Plot the data and the regression line.
