# Regresion problem
Curve fitting in numerical methods using Python
1. Use least squares regression (linear curve fitting) to fit a straight line to the following data:  
x = [0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 19]
y = [5, 6, 7, 6, 9, 8, 7, 10, 12, 12]

a. Slope
b. Intercept
c. Correlation coefficient
d. Relative Errors of the estimate.
e. Plot the data and the regression line.


# Newton Raphson Method
Implement Newton-Raphson method using MATLAB to compute the drag coefficient c needed for a parachutist of mass m = First Two Digits of Your Registration Number * 2 kg to have a
velocity of Second Last Digit of Your Registration Number + 40 m/s after free falling for time t =
Last Digit of your Registration Number + 5 secs. Note: The acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2.
