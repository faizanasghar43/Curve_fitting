"""Problem Statement:
Implement Newton-Raphson method using MATLAB to compute the drag coefficient c needed
for a parachutist of mass m = First Two Digits of Your Registration Number รท 2 kg to have a
velocity of Second Last Digit of Your Registration Number + 40 m/s after free falling for time t =
Last Digit of your Registration Number + 5 secs. Note: The acceleration due to gravity is 9.81
m/s 2 .
The drag coefficient is given by

.
b. Choose an appropriate initial guess to start iterations in order to achieve convergence. If the
solution diverges re-choose the initial guess.
c. Calculate the approximated error after every iteration and tabulate your results.
d. The ending criteria of the numerical computation is such that the consecutive calculations
have a precision of 1e-4 (For Even Registration Number) and 1e-5 (For Odd Registration
Number).
e. Plot the computed drag coefficient values with respect to the number of iterations to show
convergence.
f. Validate the computed value."""
